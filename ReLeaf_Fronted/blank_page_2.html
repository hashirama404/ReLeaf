        <h3>About this project</h3>
        <p>
          We're reaching out in response to the recent flooding in Hong Kong. The city, known for its resilience, is facing tough times, and we're launching a relief fund project to provide immediate help and contribute to the long-term recovery of affected areas. Families are dealing with damaged homes, lost belongings, and disrupted lives. Our goal is to swiftly distribute essential supplies, support the rebuilding of homes and infrastructure, and ensure continuity in education and access to vital medical services. Your support, be it financial, spreading the word, or volunteering, is crucial. We promise to keep you informed about how your contributions are making a real difference on the ground. Thank you for standing with us during these tough times, bringing hope, resilience, and recovery to the communities affected by the floods in Hong Kong.
